Tools.ControlValidation
=======================

A library that provides validation capabilities for WinForms controls.
Fluent, customizable and easily expandable.

What does it do for me?
-----------------------

This library uses [ErrorProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.errorprovider%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) components to validate controls inside your form, by setting
validation conditions, and by presenting messages to user.
